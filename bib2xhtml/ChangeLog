	  </style>

	  corresponding Unicode characters, and output valid XML coded
	  in UTF-8.
	  Note with this option documents must specify
	  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	  at their top.
	  HTML documents should better also specify
	  <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
	  and/or arrange with their web server to indicate the UTF-8 encoding
	  as part of the HTTP header.

	In a regular expression, "." doen't match newline, and so some
	patterns weren't matching that should.  I replaced the "." with
	[^\001].  An alternative would have been to add the /s option,
	but that would have only worked under Perl 5.

Wed Jan 22 19:29:33 1997  David Hull  <hull@pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu>
