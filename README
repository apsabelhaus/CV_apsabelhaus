Drew's CV!

Contained here is the LaTeX version of my CV.
Many thanks to Debarghya Das and Vel of latextemplates.com for the template.
Modifications include the header (for my longer name) and playing around with the column construction and spacing.

There are two documents here. The 1/2 inch margins CV is the updated one, because it's nicer, but I'm keeping around a 1 inch margin one just in case.
The 1 inch margins CV is NOT updated regularly.
